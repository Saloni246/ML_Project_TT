# ML_Project_TT

Project 1 : Visualisation of Data

            Dataset 1: Covid-19 country wise cases from january to march
            
            Dataset 2: Continent-Country Names

Project 2 : Supervised Machine-learning Algorithm
            
             1)Logistic Regression
             2)Support Vector Machines
             3)K-nearest neighbour
             4)Decision tree
             
             Task--find the accuracy of different models trained on the DataSet and show the comparison between them.
             
Project 3 : Unsupervised Machine-learning Algorithm

             1)K-mean Clustering
                -Plot elbow graph
                -Find value of number of clusters
                
             2)Hierarchial Clustering
                -Plot Dendrogram
                -Find value of number of clusters
                
             3)DBSCAN
               -Find Minimum value and Eps(radius)
             
             Task--Draw comparison among them by drawing clustering graph
